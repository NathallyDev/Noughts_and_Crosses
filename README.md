# Noughts_and_Crosses

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Noughts and Crosses. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking the cells with either "X" or "O". The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game results in a tie.

- **Turn-Based**: Players take turns marking the cells.
